Submersible
===========

A 2D underwater endurance-based game written in C++. This project is a required element for the G52CPP - C++ Programming module at the University of Nottingham. The game makes use of an SDL framework provided by the module conveyor, [Jason Atkin](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~jaa/).

The game features infinitely scrolling random terrain generated using the [midpoint displacement algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm#Midpoint_displacement_algorithm), random game object placement and several subtle animations.
